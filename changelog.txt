/* v0.3.5 */

-created "event_calendar_html_tag_cleaner" which is much more flexible at stripping html tags
	- uses user defined array of allowed tags. ($EVENT_CALENDAR_allowed_html_tags) 


/* v0.3 */
-added alternate authentication method: user now defines a function to return true.
	--added code for additional form fields to support this change
-changed all connection calls to one global connection defined in usr_defines

-added ability to delete events from the "edit event" form

-fixed issue with event_description not detecting some <a href=""> tags
	--turns out it was an issue detecting any tags with " in. Re-coded the whole section to perform a bit better.
	
- You can know have an event_edit and event_create form on the same page without major conflicts
	--there will still be issues with one form picking up data from the other after a post (might fix, but I don't think you should have 2 forms on the same page anyways)




/* v0.2.3 */
-fixed issue with "text_cleaner" cleaning apostrophes twice, leading to &amp;apos; stored in database.
-fixed issue in "create_event_edit_form" where your could go onto infinite list pages of blank tables.
-modified "generate_get_string" to allow exclusions, useful when wanting to return to a page, dropping some GET values

-added '[X]' link to the top right of "calendar_event_info_display", which closes the info panel.
-added default values to "create_event" form: date is now automatically set as today's date.




/* v0.2.2 */

-added support for some html tags in event description
	-available tags can be selecte in user config.
	-currently only "<a>" and/or  "<b> <i> and <u>" or "all HTML" can be selected.

-new function "create_event_list"
	-allows a list of events to be output, either in <ul> or <table> format

-added "create_event_edit_form", so now you can edit your events.




/* v0.2.1 */

-Added new user variable 'INPUT_FORM_MINUTE_ACCURACY' which allows user to set accuracy of times for events. This sets the steps for "create_event_form" 'time_mins' option

bugfixes:
	-data form now correctly sets 'selected="selected"' for dates/times in $_POST
	-data form: unset($_POST[description]) instead of $_POST[event_description], because i'm stupid and can't remember the names I've given to variables.

misc:
	-added in tasklist.txt to show what I intend to add in future versions.



/* v0.2: */

-'validate_post_data' now checks for validity of dates
-'create_new_event_form' now creates the start day/month/year/hour/min as seperate select options, then formats to sql in script (should avoid user confusion with datetime data format)
-updated 'display_event_info' to display error if event data not found.
-'create_event_form' no longer unsets all $_POST variables if sucessful, only password, event_title, description and location (Makes it easier to add lots of events in one session)

bugfixes:
	-updated 'display_event_info' to create instances of <br> where a new line character is present in the description.
	-updated 'validate_post_data' to change all quotations in event_title or locations into HTML special characters aswell
	
misc:
	-updated README.txt
	-added changlog.txt
	-will add "tasklist.txt" (what I intend to add), but this is currently on a different computer
